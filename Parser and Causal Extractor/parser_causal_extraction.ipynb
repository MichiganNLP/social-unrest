       " 'When such conflict becomes violent, it can have dramatic consequences on human wellbeing.',\n",
       " 'Mor tality from war and interpersonal violence amounts to 0.5 to 1 million deaths annually , with nonlethal impacts, including injury and lost eco nomic opportunities, affecting millions more.',\n",
       " 'Be cause the stakes are so high, understanding the causes of human conflict has been a major project in the social sciences.',\n",
       " 'Researchers working across multiple dis ciplines including archaeology, criminology, eco nomics, geography, history, political science, and psychology have long debated the extent to which climatic changes are responsible for causing con flict, violence, or political instability.',\n",
       " 'Numerous pathways linking the climate to these outcomes have been proposed.',\n",
       " 'For example, climatic changes may alter the supply of a resource and cause disagreement over its allocation, or climatic con ditions may shape the relative appeal of using violence or cooperation to achieve some precon ceived objective.',\n",
       " 'Qualitative researchers have a welldeveloped history of studying these issues dating back, at least, to the start of the 20th century .',\n",
       " 'Yet, in recent years, growing recog nition that the climate is changing, coupled with improvements in data quality and computing, has prompted an explosion of quantitative analyses seeking to test these theories and quantify the strength of these previously proposed linkages.',\n",
       " 'Thus far, this work has remained scattered across multiple disciplines and has been difficult to syn thesize given the disparate methodologies, data, and interests of the various research teams.',\n",

       " 'Although various conflict outcomes differ in important ways, we find that the behavior of these outcomes relative to the climate system is markedly similar.',\n",
       " 'Put most simply, we find that large deviations from normal precipitation and mild temperatures systematically increase the risk of many types of conflict, often substantially, and that this relationship appears to hold over a varie ty of temporal and spatial scales.',\n",
       " 'Our metaanalysis of studies that examine populations in the post 1950 era suggests that these relationships contin ue to be highly important in the modern world, although there are notable differences in the mag nitude of the relationship when different variables are considered The standardized effect of tem perature is generally larger than the standardized effect of rainfall, and the effect on intergroup violence is larger than the effect on interpersonal violence .',\n",

       " 'The Direction and Magnitude of Climatic Influence on Human Conflict We must consider the magnitude of the climates influence to evaluate whether climatic events play an important role in the occurrence of conflict and whether anthropogenic climate change has the potential to substantially alter future conflict outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Quantifying the magnitude of climatic impact in archaeological and paleoclimatological studies is difficult because outcomes of interest are often oneoff cataclysmic events e.g., so cietal collapse, and we typically do not observe how the universe of societies would have re sponded to similarsized shocks.',\n",
       " 'Modern data samples, however, generally contain a large num ber of comparable social units that are repeatedly exposed to climatic variation, and this setting is more amenable to statistical analyses that quantify how changes in climate affect the risk of conflict within an individual social unit.',\n",
       " 'To compare quantitative results across studies of modern data, we computed standardized effect sizes for those studies where it was possible to do so, evaluating the effect of a 1s change in the explanatory climate variable and expressing the result as a percentage change in the outcome variable.',\n",
       " 'Because we restrict our attention to studies that examine changes in climate varia bles over time, the relevant SD is based only on intertemporal changes at each specific location instead of comparing variation in climate across different geographic locations.',\n",
       " 'Our results are displayed in Figs. 4 and 5 .',\n",
       " 'Nearly all studies suggest that warmer temperatures, lower or more extreme rainfall, or warmer El Nio Southern Oscillation conditions lead to a 2 to 40 increase in the conflict outcome per www.sciencemag.org SCIENCE VOL 341 13 SEPTEMBER 2013 12353679 RESEARCH ARTICLE on September 12, 2013 www.sciencemag.org Downloaded from 1s in the observed climate variable.',\n",
       " 'The consist ent direction of temperatures influence is partic ularly notable because all 27 modern estimates including ENSO and temperaturebased drought indices, 20 estimates are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that warmer conditions generate more conflict, a result that would be extremely unlikely to occur by chance alone if temperature had no effect on conflict.',\n",
       " 'It is more difficult to interpret whether the signs of rainfallrelated variables agree because these variables are parameterized several different ways, so Figs. 4 and 5 present likelihoods for different parameterizations sepa rately.',\n",
       " 'However, if all modern rainfall estimates are pooled including ENSO and rainfallbased drought indices, 13 estimates are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 using signs shown in Figs. 4 and 5, then the signs of the effects in 16 out of 18 esti mates agree.',\n",
       " 'Under the assumption that there is some un derlying similarity across studies, we compute the average effect of climate variables across studies by weighting each estimate according to its precision the inverse of the estimated var iance, a common approach that penalizes uncer tain estimates .',\n",
       " 'We also calculate the CI on this mean by assuming independence across studies, although this assumption is not critical to our central findings in the supplementary materials, we present results where we relax this assumption and show that it is not essential.',\n",
       " 'The precision weighted average effect on interpersonal conflict is a 2.3 increase for each 1s change in climatic variables SE  0.12, P  0.001 Fig. 4 and table S1 and the analogous estimate for intergroup conflict is 11.1 SE  1.3, P  0.001 Fig. 5 and table S1.',\n",
       " 'These precisionweighted averages are relatively uninfluenced by outliers because outlier estimates in our sample tend to have low precision and, thus, low weight in the meta analysis.',\n",
       " 'The corresponding medians, which are also insensitive to outliers, are comparable 3.9 for personal conflict and 13.6 for group con flict.',\n",
       " 'If we restrict our attention to only the effects of temperature, the precisionweighted average effect is similar for interpersonal conflict  however, for intergroup conflict, the effect rises to 13.2 per 1s in temperature SE  2.0, P  0.001 Fig. 5.',\n",
       " 'Regarding the interpretation of these effect sizes, we note that whereas the aver age effect for interpersonal violence is smaller than the average effect for intergroup conflict in percentage terms, the baseline number of inci dents of interpersonal violence is dramatically higher, meaning a small percentage increase can represent a substantial increase in total incidents.',\n",
       " 'We estimate the precisionweighted proba bility distribution of studylevel effect sizes in Figs. 4 and 5 and in table S1.',\n",
       " 'These distributions are centered at the precisionweighted averages described above and can be interpreted as the distribution of results from which studies find ings are drawn.',\n",
       " 'The distribution for interpersonal conflict is narrow around its mean, probably be cause most interpersonal conflict studies focus on one country and use very large samples and derive very precise estimates.',\n",
       " 'The distribution for intergroup conflict is broader and covers values that are larger in magnitude, with an interquartile range of 6 to 14 per 1s and the 5th to 95th percentiles spanning 5 to 32 per 1s .',\n",
       " 'We estimate that for the intergroup and interpersonal conflict studies, respectively, 10 and 0 of the probability mass of the distri butions of effect sizes lies below zero.',\n",
       " 'Figures 4 and 5 make it clear that even though there is substantial agreement across results, some heterogeneity across estimates remains.',\n",
       " 'It is pos sible that some of this variation is meaningful, perhaps because different types of climate var iables have different impacts or because the so cial, economic, political, or geographic conditions of a society mediate its response to climatic events.',\n",
       " 'For instance, poorer populations appear to have larger responses, consistent with prior findings that such populations are more vulnerable to cli matic shifts .',\n",
       " 'However, it is also possible that some of this variation is due to differences in how conflict outcomes are defined, measurement error in climate variables, or remaining differences in model specifications that we could not correct in our reanalysis.',\n",
       " 'To formally characterize the variation in esti mated responses across studies, we use a Bayesian hierarchical model that does not require knowl edge of the source of betweenstudy variation .Underthisapproach, estimates of the precisionweighted mean are es sentially unchanged, and we recover estimates for the betweenstudy SD a measure of the un derlying dispersion of true effect sizes across studies that are half of the precisionweighted mean for interpersonal conflict and twothirds of the precisionweighted mean for intergroup con flict median estimates see supplementary mate rials, fig.',\n",
       " 'S3, and tables S2 and S3.',\n",
       " 'By comparison, if variation in effect sizes across studies was driven by sampling variation alone, then this SD in the underlying distribution of effect sizes would be zero.',\n",
       " 'This finding suggests that true effects probably differ across settings, and under standing this heterogeneity should be a primary goal of future research.',\n",
       " 'Publication Bias Publication bias is a longstanding concern across the sciences, with a common form of bias arising from the research communitys perceived prefer ence for positive rather than null results.',\n",
       " 'Al though it is always possible that publication bias played a role in the publication of a specific analysis, there are multiple reasons why publica tion bias is unlikely to be driving our findings about the literature on climate and conflict.',\n",
